description: This episode is why I love Matt as a DM. He knows his players are
  having a rough time, and while he's not making things obvious and easy, he is
  giving them a break from the fast paced, action-packed drama with some
  friendly faces and things for his friends to be excited about. He knows what
  his players, and what's more his friends, need in order to keep things fun for
  everyone. Amazing DM'ing

Beau's relationship with Dairon is one of my favourites on this show. From the whole 'tough love' approach of Dairon absolutely schooling her in the early days, to them finding a master/apprentice balance and then as equals in the Dynasty, and her promotion to expositor, to this place they're in now where they're basically friends and family, if not quite as close as Beau is to the Nein. It's such a well structure, constantly evolving and growing relationship and I'm here for it.
