  ## Introduction

    Sahseh is a sophisticated e-commerce platform built on modern web technologies, designed to handle complex discount code operations at scale. Launched in 2019, the platform implements advanced algorithms for real-time coupon validation and application, serving the MENA region through a distributed architecture.

    ## Technical Architecture

    ### Frontend Architecture

    The frontend is built on Vue.js 3 with Nuxt.js, implementing a robust component-based architecture:
    - **State Management**: Pinia for predictable state mutations

    - **Routing**: Vue Router with dynamic route handling

    - **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS for utility-first styling

    - **Internationalization**: Nuxt i18n module for Arabic/English support

    - **Performance**: Implements lazy loading and component hydration

    - **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints with JSON:API specification

    ### Core Features Implementation

    * ### Coupon Engine
      The platform's core functionality is powered by:
      - Real-time validation system for coupon codes
      - Asynchronous processing of discount calculations
      - Rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms
      - Caching layer for frequently accessed codes
      - Automated expiry handling and cleanup

    * ### Multi-Platform Integration
      Cross-platform compatibility achieved through:
      - Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
      - Native bridge for mobile applications
      - Browser extension utilizing content scripts
      - Shared core logic across platforms
      - WebSocket connections for real-time updates

    * ### Performance Optimizations
      - Implemented code splitting and lazy loading
      - Asset optimization and CDN distribution
      - Service Worker for offline capabilities
      - Memory-efficient state management
      - Optimized database queries and indexing

    ## Technical Stack Details

    ### Frontend Technologies
